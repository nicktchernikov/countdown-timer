# TODO 
* Persistence of current countdown time if user closes and reopens a tab
* Add ability to add a sequence of timers that automatically start
- e.g. 
    Pomodoro method: 
        45 minutes with label "WORK",
        15 mintutes with label "REST"
        x set amount of times 
- When one timer reaches 0, the next one in the sequence starts
